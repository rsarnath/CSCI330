Using the videos for the Week 3 lectures in D2L, write the Lisp code for the following algorithms:
1. Sequential Search. The inputs to this funtion will be a list and a target item. The function should return the position of 
of the target item in the list, or return -1 if the item is not found.
2. Bubblesort. The input to this function is an unsorted list of numbers. The function returns the list with the 
numbers arranged in non-decreasing order.

Upload/create separate .lisp files for both assignments. In both files all functions should be explained with detailed comments
